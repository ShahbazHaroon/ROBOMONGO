MongoDB GUI Client - ROBOMONGO

<p><a href="http://robomongo.org/" target="_blank">Robomongo</a>. It is simple and small in size and there are versions for Windows, Linux and Mac too. Just download and install and get started.</p>

<p>After successful installation, just click on the icon and you can see the following screen:</p>

<p>In this screen you can configure the database server host and port. In my case host and port are localhost and 9999 respectively. After that click connect and you are done. You can browse the already existing databases or create new ones. Here is a screenshot:</p>
